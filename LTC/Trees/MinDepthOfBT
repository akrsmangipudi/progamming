Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

/**
 * Definition for binary tree
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     struct TreeNode *left;
 *     struct TreeNode *right;
  * };
 */
int minDepth(struct TreeNode *root) 
{
    if( !root )
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    int leftHeight  = minDepth( root->left );
    int rightHeight = minDepth( root->right );
    
    return ( leftHeight < rightHeight ) ? ( ( leftHeight != 0 ) ? 1 + leftHeight : 1 + rightHeight ) : ( ( rightHeight != 0 ) ? 1 + rightHeight : 1 + leftHeight );
}
